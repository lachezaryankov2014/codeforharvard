 * Building a battery charging controller.
 *
 * We have batteries to store the power generated by our solar panels, but the charging
 * was handled by the building AI, which has been disabled.
 *
 * We'll use a HERO XL to control the charging and use of our battery array, using a
 * photoresistor to simulate our solar panels and variables in the code to track our
 * battery level.
 *
 * A photoresistor is a light-sensitive component that changes resistance based on the
 * amount of light it receives.  When light increases, the resistance decreases.
 *
 * Since we'll be powering our lights from the batteries we'll be adding on to our
 * previous switched light circuit and code.

/* Choosing what pin to use.
 * This project only needs digital pins.  So, on the Hero XL we *could* use any digital or analog pin
 * (D0-D53, A0-A15).  However, some pins support specialized functions and in later lessons we will be
 * using multiple parts, some of which will use some of those special functions.  So, let's start out
 * on the right foot by trying to use the most basic pin we can for each of our parts.
 *
 * Skip: A0-A15 (save for Analog),
 *       D0/D1 (used by USB and Serial)
 *       D14-D19 (used by Serial 1-3)
 *       D2/D3, D18-D21 (used for external interrupts)
 *       D13 (this pin controls the build in LED on the HERO XL board (LED_BUILTIN)),
 *       D2-D13, D44-D46 (used for Pulse Width Modulation (PWM))
 *       D50 (MISO), D51 (MOSI), D52 (SCK), D53 (SS).  (used for SPI communication)
 *       D20 (SDA), D21 (SCL).  (used for I2C communication using the Wire library)
 * Recommended for fewest conflicts:
 *    D22-D43, D47-D49, A8-A15
